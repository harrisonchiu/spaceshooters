# space-shooters-JS
Javascript arcade top-down shooter game.

To run game, setup local server for html file because running local JS files directly on the browser will be blocked. Browsers block this to prevent JS files from accessing local files for security, but this program needs it to access its libraries and visuals.

Example: type "python -m http.server" in python terminal and go to the local host.
